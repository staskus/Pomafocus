# Pomafocus Work Plan

## Active Tasks
- [x] Add lightweight stats storage (focus session summaries + daily rollups).
- [x] Log session outcomes (completed vs. stopped) from PomodoroSessionController.
- [x] Build iOS Stats screen with weekly summary, streak, and completion rate.
- [x] Add a Focus/Stats tab switch in the iOS app.
- [x] Add weekly recap card with delta vs. last week.
- [x] Add focus presets for common session lengths.
- [x] Add session tags and store them with stats.
- [x] Track Deep Breath starts/confirms/timeouts and surface them in stats.
- [x] Count focus minutes using completed sessions only.
- [x] Track stopped sessions separately in stats.
- [x] Add session length distribution chart.

## Backlog (Later)
- Block attempt logging (app/site, time-of-day heatmap).
- Cross-device stats sync (rollups only).
- Distribution/insights charts (heatmap, histogram, time-of-day density).
- Badges/rewards (streaks, milestones, weekly wins).
- Focus “what worked” insights (correlate time-of-day and completion).
- Session notes or journal entry after completion.
- Focus soundscapes or ritual start cue.
- Team sprint/shared streaks.
- Adaptive block windows based on temptation peaks.

## Open Questions
- Weekly focus target: user-defined or app-suggested default?
- Should block attempts stay local-only by default (privacy) or sync rollups?
